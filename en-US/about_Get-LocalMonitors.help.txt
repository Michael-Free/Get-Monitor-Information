SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Retrieves monitor information from the local computer using WMI and EDID data.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The Get-LocalMonitors function collects detailed information about monitors
    connected to the local computer by querying the 'WMIMonitorID' class in the
    WMI root\WMI namespace.

    This function extracts the manufacturer code, model name, and serial number
    from EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) and translates manufacturer
    codes into friendly names using a built-in mapping table.

    It returns a list of custom objects, each representing one connected monitor,
    including its manufacturer, model, serial number, and the name of the
    attached computer.

    Note:
    - This function does not currently support querying remote computers.
    - Administrator privileges may be required to access WMI data on some systems.

Optional Subtopics
    None
