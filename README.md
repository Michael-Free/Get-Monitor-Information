~~# Get Monitor Information~~
~~A Powershell Module/Script that gets the serial number, make and model of a monitor(s) attached to a computer via WMI~~
~~~~
~~## Module vs Script~~
~~I've included both a module and script version of this. This allows you to either run it quickly for one-off situations (script version) or install it (module ~~version) into your PSModule path (see instructions below) for long-term use without relying on a having the script file's path.
~~~~
~~## Module Installation~~
~~If you choose to install the .psm1 module version of this, follow these instructions:~~
~~~~
~~1. Find your PSModule paths by running `$env:PSModulePath.Split(";")` in a Powershell prompt~~
~~2. Place a folder in any one of these paths named Monitor-Information (this can actually be anything)~~
~~3. Place Monitor-Information.psm1 inside of this folder~~
~~4. If you have Powershell 3 or higher running the command (in this case Get-Monitor) will automatically import the module, otherwise you'll need to run ~~`Import-Module Monitor-Information` and then run the command.
~~~~
~~## Usage (Script)~~
~~To use the script:~~
~~~~
~~```PowerShell~~
~~PS C:\Scripts\> Get-Monitor.ps1 -ComputerName SSL1-F1102-1G2Z~~
~~~~
~~Manufacturer Model    SerialNumber AttachedComputer~~
~~------------ -----    ------------ ----------------~~
~~HP           HP E241i CN12345678   SSL1-F1102-1G2Z~~
~~HP           HP E241i CN91234567   SSL1-F1102-1G2Z~~
~~```~~
~~~~
~~You can also use it with multiple computers:~~
~~```PowerShell~~
~~PS C:\Scripts\> $Computers = @("SSL7-F108F-9D4Z","SSL1-F1102-1G2Z","SSA7-F1071-0T7F")~~
~~PS C:\Scripts\> Get-Monitor.ps1 -ComputerName $Computers~~

~~Manufacturer Model      SerialNumber AttachedComputer~~
~~------------ -----      ------------ ----------------~~

~~HP           HP ZR22w   CN67891234   SSA7-F1071-0T7F~~
~~```~~
~~~~
~~## Usage (Module)~~
~~The module version is identical accept you don't have to reference the script file and its location, you simply have to run the command from any directory. ~~Once the module is installed, use the command:
~~~~
~~```PowerShell~~
~~PS C:\Scripts\> Get-Monitor -ComputerName SSL1-F1102-1G2Z~~
~~~~
~~Manufacturer Model    SerialNumber AttachedComputer~~
~~------------ -----    ------------ ----------------~~
~~HP           HP E241i CN12345678   SSL1-F1102-1G2Z~~
~~HP           HP E241i CN91234567   SSL1-F1102-1G2Z~~
~~```~~
~~~~
~~You can also use it with multiple computers:~~
~~```PowerShell~~
~~PS C:\Scripts\> $Computers = @("SSL7-F108F-9D4Z","SSL1-F1102-1G2Z","SSA7-F1071-0T7F")~~
~~PS C:\Scripts\> Get-Monitor -ComputerName $Computers~~
